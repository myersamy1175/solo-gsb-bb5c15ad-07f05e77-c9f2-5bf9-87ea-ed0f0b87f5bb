"""CIDR allow/deny normalization built on the standard-library ``ipaddress``.

The core operation is a set difference ``allow - deny`` computed independently
for IPv4 and IPv6.  When a deny prefix cuts through an allow prefix the allow
network is recursively split into its two halves until every deny boundary is
aligned with a prefix.  Pieces are merged back only when they form two
complete, adjacent sibling prefixes (via :func:`ipaddress.collapse_addresses`),
which yields the equivalent, non-overlapping and minimum-cardinality CIDR set.

The module also hosts three scope-based consumers of the same primitives:
``compare`` (decision diff of two policy sets inside one scope),
``audit_rules`` (per-entry impact classification inside one scope) and
``minimize_policy`` (minimum-cardinality equivalent rule subset inside one
scope), plus ``allocate`` (lexicographically smallest non-overlapping subnet
assignment inside one scope, avoiding occupied CIDRs).
